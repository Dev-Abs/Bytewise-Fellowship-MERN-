# Bytewise Fellowship (MERN) - Daily Progress

Welcome to my Bytewise Fellowship (MERN) repository! This repository will serve as a daily log of my progress throughout the 3-month fellowship program.

## About the Fellowship

The Bytewise Fellowship is an intensive program focused on mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Over the course of three months, I will be working on various projects and assignments to enhance my skills in full-stack development.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to reflect my day-to-day progress. Each folder corresponds to a specific day, containing all the relevant code, notes, and resources for that day's work.
